# ScreamScript
#### **For All Your Screaming Needs**

Unleash your inner banshee with **ScreamScript**, the programming language that perfectly captures your frustration with life, code, and everything in between. Ideal for developers who want to scream, cry, and laugh—all at the same time.

---  

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Usage**
Running your ScreamScript masterpiece is simple:
```bash
ScreamScript.exe [source file path]
```  

Still confused? Perfect. That means you’re ready to begin.

## 🗣️ **Syntax Overview**

### 📋 **Global Rules**
- **Only the letters `A`, `G`, and `H` are allowed in your code**, with the mandatory `!` separator. Anything else will cause an interpreter meltdown.
- **Every command or statement ends with `!`.** Because punctuation is rage.

#### What happens if you break the rules?
The interpreter will throw tantrums so loud, you’ll wish you had followed them.

---  

### 📋 **Literals and Variables**
- **All variables are integers.** Fancy data types are for cowards.
- **Numeric literals must be screamed into existence:**
  - `AaA` for positive numbers (joyful screams, read as capital letters).
  - `Aaa` for negative numbers (anguished wails, red as lowercase letters).

#### **Variable Names**
- Must start with `AAAghA` to announce their arrival dramatically.
  - Example: `AAAghAaaaah`
- Follow the sacred rule: only `A`, `G`, and `H`. Anything else will make the interpreter cry.
  - Valid: `AAAghAaa`
  - Invalid: `AAA123` (Shame on you.)

#### **Declaring Variables**
- Use `AA! [variable]! [value]!` to create or overwrite a variable.
  - Example: `AA AAAghAaa! AaAahhhhggggg!` declares `AAAghAaa` with value `AaAahhhhggggg`.
- Reserved variable:
  - `AaAaaaggghhh`: **Screams random numbers** from 0 to 100.

### 🖨️ **Input and Output**

#### Input
- **Read a number from the user into a variable:**
  ```  
  AAAA! [variable]!  
  ```  
  Example: `AAAA! AAAghAaa!`

#### Output
- **Print a variable as text:**
  ```  
  AAAAA! [variable]!  
  ```  
  Example: `AAAAA! AAAghAaa!`

- **Print as raw numbers:**
  ```  
  AAaAA! [variable]!  
  ```  
  Example: `AAaAA! AAAghAaa!`

Break the rules, and the interpreter *will* make you regret it.

---  

### 🔄 **Flow Control**

#### **Conditions**
Wrap conditions in `Aa` and `aA` because every tantrum needs boundaries.  
Example:
  ```  
  Aa! AAAghAaa! AAGH! AaA! aA!  
  ```  
Translation: "Check if `AAAghAaa` is equal to `AaA`."

#### **Jump-if Command**
- **Labels** are named "waypoints" starting with `GAH`. Allowed characters: `A`, `G`, `H`.
  - Example: `GAHaa!`
- Want to flee somewhere? Scream:
  ```  
  AAGG! [condition]! [label]!  
  ```  
  Example:
  ```  
  AAGG! Aa! AAAghAaa! aaGH! AAAghAaaa! aA! GAHaa!  
  ```  
  Translation: "If `AAAghAaa` is less than `AAAghAaaa`, teleport to `GAHaa!` screaming like your life depends on it."

### 🔢 **Operators**

#### **Logic Operators**
- `AAGH` → Equals (`==`)
- `aaGH` → Less than (`<`)
- `AAgh` → Greater than (`>`)
- `aAGh` → Not equals (`!=`)

#### **Arithmetic Operators**
- `AGGH` → Addition (`+`)
- `AGGh` → Subtraction (`-`)
- `agGH` → Multiplication (`*`)
- `AgHH` → Division (`/`)

## 🌟 **Example Program**

If you’re wondering what chaos looks like, check out the example file `GuessTheNumber.scream` in this very directory. It's a tour de force of screaming logic where you guess a random number, and the interpreter screams at you until you get it right.

Embrace the chaos. **ScreamScript**: where every line is a cry for help—and that’s exactly how it’s meant to be. 🎤
